# MoviesApiSolution
Database Structure
To solve this Movie api challenge, I have a movie database with three tables
1.	Movies (MovieId, Title, yearOfRelease, RunningTime, Genre)
2.	Users (UserId, UserName)
3.	Ratings (RatingId, UserId, MovieId, RatingValue)
 			 
Improvement: I would have prefer to have Genre as Code table
C#
I have created a simple web api project, created models and controllers (entity framework action). It is in memory databaseand I used Postman to test the solution.
1.	To add movies: https://localhost:<portnumer>/api/movies/postMovies
Json example for movie: {"movieId":101,"title":"Gone with the Wind‚Äù, 				"YearOfRelease":1939,"runningTime":240,"genre":"Drama"},
2.	To add users: https://localhost:<portnumer>/api/users
Json example for user: {"userId":208,"userName":"Ashley White"}
3.	To add Ratings: https://localhost:<portnumer>/api/ratings/SaveRating
{"ratingId":14,"userId":208,"movieId":104,"ratingValue":3}
This is my solution to the API D question

API A solution link:  api/Ratings/SearchMovies
This is post method and take SearchMovie model as input. I have used a search model to pass in the search input for this solution so that if we want to search a movie with more parameters we can easily do it.  Example of search Model: { "searchString": "E.T", "genreStrign": "Drama", "year": 1930 }

API B solution link: api/Ratings/ Top5Movies (GET)
This returns details of top 5 movies based on average user ratings
API C solution link: api/Ratings/Top%moviesByUser (GET)
To get this solution I have use userId as search parameter. (It can be done username and then getting userId via username)
